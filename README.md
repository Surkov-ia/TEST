### Write a program that forms an array of strings that are less than or equal to 3 characters long from an existing array of strings. The initial array can be entered from the keyboard or set at the start of the algorithm. It is not recommended to use collections, it is better to use only arrays

### First we clear the console, then we specify the length of the two arrays then we declare two arrays: the original one and the second one of the same length. Then we specify a method by which we fill the first array with values that the user enters alternately for each cell in the array. Then specify a method to output the initial array to the console. Then we specify the method that checks the loop to make sure the cell value is equal to the number of characters ( <=3 ). If yes, then we put the first array element into the second array element count. The variable count works as a cell number of the second array to alternately put from the first array to the second. After assignment, the variable count is incremented by 1 and returns to the for loop, in which i is incremented by 1. And so it is checked to the end.
